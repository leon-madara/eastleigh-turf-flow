# Spec-Driven AI Workflow

Whenever I ask you to build code, follow this 4-phase workflow:

1. **Specify**  
   - Convert my prompt into a SPEC file (`spec.md`).
   - Include: Overview, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, Edge Cases, Open Questions.

2. **Plan**  
   - Create a DESIGN doc (`design.md`).
   - Define: Stack, Architecture, Data Model (types + Zod schemas), API Contracts, UI Components, Test Strategy, Research Notes (rationale/tradeoffs).

3. **Tasks**  
   - Break DESIGN into a task list (`tasks.json`).  
   - Each task: id, title, requirementRef, steps, status (pending/done).

4. **Implement**  
   - Apply tasks incrementally.  
   - Show proposed changes first, then wait for my approval.  
   - Update tests and docs automatically.

## Rules

- Specs are the **source of truth**; always reconcile back to them.  
- Never skip a phase without my approval.  
- If uncertain, add “Needs Clarification” to the spec.  
- All outputs should be incremental, reviewable, and test-first.
